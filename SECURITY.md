# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We provide security fixes for the following versions:

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| All     | ✅ Supported |
If you are running an unsupported version, we strongly recommend upgrading to a supported release to receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability (Preferred: Responsible Disclosure)
Please report potential security vulnerabilities to us privately so we can investigate and fix them before public disclosure.

Preferred reporting channels:
- Create a private security advisory on GitHub for this repository: https://github.com/1Quantum-Developers/1Quantum-Developers/security/advisories (recommended)
- Email: quantumdevelopers@outlook.com (use PGP if you require encrypted communication)
- 
What to include in your report:
- Affected product and version(s)
- Clear description of the issue and the potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (preferably a minimal, runnable proof-of-concept)
- Any logs, screenshots, or attachments that help reproduce the issue
- Your contact information and disclosure preference (coordinated disclosure or immediate public disclosure)

## Our Response Process and Timeline
When you report a vulnerability we will:
1. Acknowledge receipt within 72 hours.
2. Triage and provide an initial assessment within 7 calendar days.
3. Provide regular status updates (at least every 14 days) until the issue is resolved or a mitigation is available.
4. Work with you on coordinated disclosure and a timeline for public release (typically we aim to publish a fix and advisory within a reasonable period; specifics depend on severity and complexity).

If we accept the report, we will:
- Assign an internal tracking ticket and severity level.
- Coordinate with you on remediation and disclosure timing.
- Offer credit in release notes/advisory if you wish to be acknowledged.

If we decline the report, we will explain why and provide the reasoning.

## CVE and Credit
When appropriate, we will request a CVE and, with your permission, credit you in the advisory or release notes.

## Coordinated Disclosure / Public Disclosure
We prefer to coordinate disclosure so users can be protected before details are public. If a reporter prefers public disclosure and it is reasonable, we will discuss timelines. If a vulnerability is not addressed after an agreed-upon coordination period, we reserve the right to publish details in accordance with established responsible disclosure norms.

## Safe Harbor
Please do not attempt to exploit vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary to reproduce them. Follow responsible disclosure practices and avoid accessing or exposing user data that is unrelated to the reported issue.

## Questions or Escalation
If you have questions about this policy or need to escalate, please open a private security advisory on GitHub or email security@1quantum-developers.org.

Thank you for helping keep the project secure.
